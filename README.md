# Numerical PDE
Numerical solutions of 2D partial differential equations with Finite Differences and Pseudospectral methods coded in Julia.

The examples given in the Jupyter Notebooks are based on the course ["Computers, Waves, Simulations: A Practical Introduction to Numerical Methods using Python"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computers-waves-simulations/) from LMU in Coursera.
